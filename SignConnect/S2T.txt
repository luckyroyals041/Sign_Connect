Sure! Here are the key steps summarized from the tutorial on building an American Sign Language translator:

1. Creating the Project and Installing Dependencies :
   - Create a workspace and install necessary packages like PyTorch, OpenCV, numpy, and onnx.

2. Preparing the Sign Language Classification Dataset :
   - Download and preprocess the dataset, create a PyTorch Dataset class, and apply data augmentation.

3. Building and Training the Sign Language Classifier Using Deep Learning :
   - Define a neural network, set up a loss function and optimizer, and train the model.

4. Evaluating the Sign Language Classifier :
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy on the validation set and export the trained model to ONNX format.

5. Linking the Camera Feed :
   - Use the trained model to classify sign language from webcam input in real-time.
