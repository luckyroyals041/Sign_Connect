Sign_to_Audio

1. **Sign Language Recognition**:
   - Capture the sign language input (e.g., video of hand gestures).
   - Use computer vision techniques (such as Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs) to recognize the signs.
   - Map each recognized sign to its corresponding word or phrase in spoken language.

2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion**:
   - Once you have the recognized text, use a TTS engine (such as Google Text-to-Speech, gTTS) to convert the text into audio.
   - TTS engines generate natural-sounding speech from written text.

3. **Audio Playback**:
   - Play the generated audio to provide the spoken language equivalent of the sign language input.
