Audio_to_Sign

1. Audio Preprocessing:
   - Capture the audio input (spoken language).
   - Convert the audio signal to a digital representation (e.g., waveform or spectrogram).

2. Speech Recognition:
   - Use automatic speech recognition (ASR) to transcribe the spoken language into text.
   - ASR models can be trained using deep learning techniques (e.g., recurrent neural networks, transformer-based models).

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
   - Process the transcribed text:
     - Tokenize the text into words or phrases.
     - Remove punctuation and normalize the text.

4. Translation Mapping:
   - Create a mapping between words or phrases in the spoken language and their corresponding signs in sign language.
   - This mapping can be manually curated or learned from a dataset.

5. Sign Language Representation:
   - Represent signs using a suitable notation (e.g., SignWriting, Pose Sequence, etc.).
   - Each sign corresponds to a specific hand gesture or movement.

6. Text-to-Sign Conversion:
   - For each word or phrase in the transcribed text:
     - Look up the corresponding sign(s) from the translation mapping.
     - Combine the signs to form a complete sign sequence.

7. Visualization or Animation:
   - Display the sign sequence visually:
     - Use a 3D avatar or skeleton viewer to show the sign gestures.
     - Animate the avatar's hands and body to mimic the sign language.
