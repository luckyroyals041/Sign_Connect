Text_to_Sign

1. Preprocessing:
   - Take the input text (spoken language) and preprocess it:
     - Remove punctuation.
     - Tokenize the text into words or phrases.
     - Normalize the text (e.g., convert to lowercase).

2. Translation Mapping:
   - Create a mapping between words or phrases in the spoken language and their corresponding signs in sign language.
   - This mapping can be manually curated or learned from a dataset.

3. Sign Language Representation:
   - Represent signs using a suitable notation (e.g., SignWriting, Pose Sequence, etc.).
   - Each sign corresponds to a specific hand gesture or movement.

4. Text-to-Sign Conversion:
   - For each word or phrase in the input text:
     - Look up the corresponding sign(s) from the translation mapping.
     - Combine the signs to form a complete sign sequence.

5. Visualization or Animation:
   - Display the sign sequence visually:
     - Use a 3D avatar or skeleton viewer to show the sign gestures.
     - Animate the avatar's hands and body to mimic the sign language.
